**Project Overview: Daewoo Bus Service Website**
BY Saifullah Awan


I have developed a website for a Daewoo bus service using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**. All the code for each page (HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP) is written within a single `.php` file (e.g., `index.php` contains all code blocks together).

### **User and Admin Login Functionality:**

* **User Login:**
  Users do not need to register manually. Instead, when a user books a ticket, their name and phone number are automatically stored and used as login credentials.

* **Admin Login:**
  A single admin account is created manually in the database.

  * **Username:** `admin123@gmail.com`
  * **Password:** `12345`

> **Note:** On my local machine, the SQL password is set to `"mysql"`. If you are testing the project on your own system, please change the database connection password accordingly. If you donâ€™t have a password set, you can leave it blank.

   A simple contact page with a demo email address for visual appeal.

5. **Book Now:**

   * Users can book tickets by entering their information (e.g., ID, name, etc.).
   * The system will display the number of remaining seats based on bookings.

6. **Admin Panel:**

   * Admin can view all ticket bookings and user information.
   * Admin has the ability to delete any user booking.

7. **User Panel:**

   * Users can view their booking details (e.g., seat number).

> **Note:** A payment system has not been implemented in this project. Upon booking, users are shown a message indicating that payment will be collected at the terminal.
